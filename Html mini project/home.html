            <dd> <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the core language used to structure content on the web. 
                It organizes text, images, links, and media using tags and elements that browsers can interpret. As of 2025, over 95% of websites rely on HTML alongside CSS and JavaScript, making it a fundamental tool in modern web development.
                It is a markup language, not a programming language. This means it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
                It is a static language, meaning it does not inherently provide interactive features but can be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
                In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.

        HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of web pages, defining how content is structured and displayed.
        They are keywords enclosed in angle brackets, like <u>p</u> for a paragraph or a for a hyperlink. Opening tags like <u>p</u> mark the beginning of an element, and closing tags like <u>p</u> <u>mark</u> the end.
        Some tags, like <u>img</u> for images, are self-closing. HTML tags enable web browsers to interpret and render HTML documents as web pages.

    <strong> 1. Structure and Formatting: </strong>
HTML tags define the structure and layout of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.
They provide instructions to the browser on how to display text, images, and other media.
<br><br>
<strong>2. Opening and Closing Tags:</strong>
Most HTML tags come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., paragraph) and a closing tag (e.g., p). 
The content of an element is placed between the opening and closing tags. 
Self-closing tags, like( img or br), don't require a separate closing tag.
